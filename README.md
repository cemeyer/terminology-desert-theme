terminology-desert-theme
========================

This is a colorscheme for the EFL-based terminal, "terminology." It uses colors
similar to the gvim "desert" theme.

Building
========

Get a git checkout of 'terminology'.  Check out the tag matching your installed
version (they change how ~/.config colorschemes work between 1.11 and master).
Find the 'add_color_scheme.sh' line at the end of COLORSCHEMES.md and use that
with this Desert.ini file.
